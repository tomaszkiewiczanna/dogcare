# take care of the dog
Final project at coding school. At the begining the idea was to
 draw an animated picture using css. During the work I menaged
 to add some more action to the project.
At first User needs to choose a name for his pet and a breed. Than he can control the dog throught the action buttons (at this moment
the dog can only sit and sleep, the rest of actions are in progress).
In future Take care of the dog, will probably evolve into tamagochi kind of game.

### what still needs some work?
 - Action buttons, other than sleeping one
